Future site for gbryant.co.uk
=============================
Personal website
----------------

This is a site I'm working on for myself - it'll be basic but maintainable. I'm hoping to have a completely custom (but easily followable) frontend, and a Django-based backend. Eventually I'll be testing on a small Raspberry Pi-based webserver.

Sections will include:
* Design
* Photography
* Videography
* Projects
* Blog

Design, Photography and Videography
-----------------------------------

These are where my best work in design, photography and videography will be shown off. The videography section will probably have embedded YouTube videos.

Projects
--------

Physical projects I make will be posted here. Hopefully I'll have some sort of nice worklog system for posting them.

Blog
----

Miscellaneous stuff will go here, as well as unfinished stuff that doesn't belong in the **Projects** section.

Format
------

There'll be a set of data and metadata that all the content will have:
* Title
* Main picture
* (Optional) Extra pictures/videos
* Post date
* Text content
* 140 character *TL;DR* - automatically posted to Twitter
* Keywords
